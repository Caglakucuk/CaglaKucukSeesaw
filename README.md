## ⚖️ ***Interactive SeeSaw Simulation***
An interactive, modern, and high-performance seesaw simulation that calculates real-time torque physics. Users can place various weights on a plank to observe physical balance shifts through both visual feedback and live data dashboard.


### ✨ Key Features
• **Real-Time Physics Engine:** Calculates instantaneous balance and inclination using the torque formula (Torque=Force×Distance) based on each weight's distance from the pivot.

• **Dynamic Data Dashboard:** Provides live updates on the total weight for both sides and the current balance angle of the seesaw.

• **Weight-Based Color Coding:** Boxes are automatically categorized and colored based on their weight (Yellow, Blue, Green, Red) for easy visual identification.

• **Synchronized Sound Effects:** A high-fidelity audio effect is triggered the exact moment a box impacts the plank, perfectly synchronized with the falling animation.

• **Randomized Weight Distribution:** Every click generates a box with a random weight between 1kg and 10kg, ensuring a unique and unpredictable simulation experience.

• **Torque-Responsive Smooth Transition:** The balancing speed of the plank adjusts dynamically based on the torque difference; minor weight changes result in smooth, slow movements, while significant imbalances trigger faster stabilization.

• **Intelligent Animation Synchronization:** Falling animations, physical calculations, and audio triggers are seamlessly synchronized to provide a cohesive sensory experience.
